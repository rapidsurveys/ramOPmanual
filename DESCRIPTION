Description: HelpAge International <http://www.helpage.org., Valid International 
    <http://www.validinternational.org>, and Brixton Health <http://www.brixtonhealth.com>, 
    with financial assistance from the Humanitarian Innovation Fund (HIF) 
    <http://www.elrha.org/hif/home/>, have developed a Rapid Assessment Method for 
    Older People (RAM-OP) that provides accurate and reliable estimates of the 
    needs of older people. The method uses simple procedures, in a short time 
    frame (i.e. about two weeks including training, data collection, data entry, 
    and data analysis), and at considerably lower cost than other methods.
