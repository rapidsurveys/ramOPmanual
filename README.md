# Rapid Assessment Method for Older People (RAM-OP): The Manual

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/validmeasures/ramOPmanual.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/validmeasures/ramOPmanual)

[HelpAge International](http://www.helpage.org), [VALID International](http://www.validinternational.org), 
and [Brixton Health](http://www.brixtonhealth.com), with financial assistance from 
the [Humanitarian Innovation Fund (HIF)](http://www.elrha.org/hif/home/), have 
developed a **Rapid Assessment Method for Older People (RAM-OP)** that provides 
accurate and reliable estimates of the needs of older people. The method uses 
simple procedures, in a short time frame (i.e. about two weeks including training, 
data collection, data entry, and data analysis), and at considerably lower cost 
than other methods. The **RAM-OP** method is based on the following principles:

* Use of a familiar *“household survey”* design employing a two-stage cluster 
sample design optimised to allow the use of a small primary sample (*m ≥ 16 clusters*) 
and a small overall (*n ≥ 192*) sample.

* Assessment of multiple dimensions of need in older people (including prevalence 
of global, moderate and severe acute malnutrition) using, whenever possible, standard 
and well-tested indicators and question sets.

* Data analysis performed using modern computer-intensive methods to allow estimates 
of indicator levels to be made with useful precision using a small sample size.
