    "text": "Introduction\nOlder people (generally defined as people aged sixty years and older) are a vulnerable group for malnutrition in humanitarian and developmental contexts. Due to their age they have specific nutritional needs, such as easily digestible and palatable food adapted to those with chewing problems, which is dense in nutrients. In famine and displacement situations where populations are dependent on food distributions, older people often find the general ration inappropriate to their tastes and needs, have difficulties accessing the distributions, or have difficulties transporting rations home. As a result, older people can become malnourished and in need of specifically targeted food interventions. In times of drought or food scarcity, older people tend to reduce their food intake in order to share or give up their ration to younger members of their families. They are then at risk of malnutrition.\nDespite these potential vulnerabilities in humanitarian situations, older people are rarely identified as a group in need of specific nutritional or food assistance. Surveys and assessments almost always focus on children, and sometimes on pregnant and lactating women. Humanitarian workers argue that assessing the nutritional status and needs of older people is both costly and complicated. As a consequence, the nutritional status and needs of older people in crisis go unidentified and unaddressed.\nHelpAge International, VALID International, and Brixton Health, with financial assistance from the Humanitarian Innovation Fund (HIF), have developed a Rapid Assessment Method for Older People (RAM-OP) that provides accurate and reliable estimates of the needs of older people. The method uses simple procedures, in a short time frame (i.e. about two weeks including training, data collection, data entry, and data analysis), and at considerably lower cost than other methods. The RAM-OP method is based on the following principles:\n\nUse of a familiar “household survey” design employing a two-stage cluster sample design optimised to allow the use of a small primary sample (\\(m ≥ 16\\) clusters) and a small overall (\\(n ≥ 192\\)) sample.\nAssessment of multiple dimensions of need in older people (including prevalence of global, moderate and severe acute malnutrition) using, whenever possible, standard and well-tested indicators and question sets.\nData analysis performed using modern computer-intensive methods to allow estimates of indicator levels to be made with useful precision using a small sample size.\n\nThe following tools are currently available under the General Public Licence / Free Documentation License, meaning that you are free to copy and adapt these tools:\n\nan English language manual / guidebook\na questionnaire (available in English and French)\ndata entry and data checking software (available in English and French)\ndata analysis software.\n\nWe believe that the availability of a rapid, low-cost, and user-friendly method will encourage governments, UN agencies, as well as international and local non-governmental organisations to actively assess the situation of older people in humanitarian contexts, and implement, monitor, and evaluate relevant and timely responses to address their needs.",

Two methods can be used and both methods take the sample from all parts of the survey area:\n\nList-based method: Communities to be sampled are selected systematically from a complete list of communities in the survey area. This list of communities is sorted by one or more non-overlapping spatial factors such as district and subdistricts within districts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Communities listing by district and sub-district\n\n\n\n\nMap-based method: Communities to be sampled are selected from the centres of the squares of a grid drawn over a map. The map must be sufficiently well made and of sufficiently large scale to show the position of every community in the survey area. This type of sample is known as a centric systematic area sample and is often referred to as a CSAS sample.\n\nNote: Population proportional sampling (PPS) is not used in RAM-OP surveys. Population estimates for all communities are not required for sampling purposes. Population estimates are required only for the selected communities. These are used during data analysis in order to weight results by population size. If this information is not available before the survey, it can be collected during the survey.\n\n\n1.1.2 The second stage sample\nThe second stage within-community sample uses a method called map-segment-sample. This method takes the within-community sample from all parts of a sampled community.",

    "text": "1.2 Implicit stratification\nBoth the first and second stage samples use a form of spatial stratification:\n\nThe list-based method’s first stage systematic spatial sample stratifies the sample by non-overlapping spatial factor such as districts and subdistricts within districts.\nThe map-based (CSAS) method’s first stage sample stratifies the sample by grid square.\nThe map-segment-sample second stage within-community sample stratifies the sample by parts of the community being sampled.\nThe first and second stage samples also ensure that a reasonably even spatial sample is taken from the entire survey area and from each of the sampled communities.\n\nThese sampling procedures provide implicit stratification and tend to spread the sample properly among important sub-groups of the population such as rural / urban / peri-urban populations, administrative areas, ethnic sub-populations, religious sub-populations, and socio-economic groups. This often improves the precision of estimates made from survey data.\nThe use of implicit stratification improves the efficiency of a two-stage cluster sample and allows RAM-OP to use relatively small sample sizes compared to other methods, such as SMART surveys. The use of modern computer-intensive data analysis techniques also allows RAM-OP to make better use of the available sample than is done in other methods.",

You should aim to collect an overall sample of at least \\(n = 192\\) individuals.\nThe RAM-OP sample is collected in two stages:\n\nThe first stage sample uses a sample size of about \\(m = 16\\) communities (or PSUs).\nThe second stage sample uses a sample size of about \\(n = 12\\) eligible subjects sampled from each of the communities selected for inclusion in the first stage sample.\n\nThe overall sample size from \\(m = 16\\) communities and \\(n = 12\\) eligible subjects is about:\n \n\\[\\text{overall sample size} ~ \\approx ~ m ~ \\times ~ n ~ \\approx ~ 16 ~ \\times ~ 12 ~ \\approx ~ 192\\]\n \nIt is not recommended that fewer than \\(m = 16\\) communities are sampled.\nSampling fewer than \\(m = 16\\) communities will tend to reduce the precision with which estimates can be made. If you have the resources to sample more than \\(m = 16\\) communities then you should do so. A sample of \\(m = 24\\) communities and \\(n = 8\\) eligible subjects, for example, will tend to yield estimates with better precision than a sample with \\(m = 16\\) communities and \\(n = 12\\) eligible subjects.\nDo not be tempted to increase the size of the within-community sample in order to achieve an overall sample size of \\(n = 192\\) from fewer than \\(m = 16\\) communities. Doing so will tend to reduce the precision with which estimates are made. It may also be impossible to do this in many settings.\nHere, for example, is a population pyramid for a typical developing country:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Population pyramid for a typical developing country\n\n\n\nIf the average community population is \\(N = 300\\) then there will be fewer than 15 people aged 60 years and older in about half of the selected communities.

    "text": "1.5 Age distribution, eligibility criteria, and sample design\nThe age distribution of the population and the survey eligibility criteria will affect the sample design in terms of the number of communities that you will need to sample (\\(m\\)) and the number of older persons (\\(n\\)) that can be sampled from each community.\nThe overall sample size for a RAM-OP sample should be at least \\(n = 192\\) usually collected as \\(n = 12\\) eligible subjects sampled from \\(m = 16\\) communities. If older people make up a very small proportion (i.e. much less than 5%) of the total population and / or the average population of communities is small then you will usually need to sample more than \\(m = 16\\) communities in order to get about \\(n = 192\\) older people in the overall sample. This is likely to occur when there are fewer than 20 to 25 older people in a community of average size.\nYou can calculate the number of older people that you would expect to be living in a community of average size using the following formula:\n \n\\[n_{\\text{aged 60+ in an average village}} ~ = ~ \\text{average village population}_{\\text{all ages}} ~ \\times ~ \\frac{\\text{percentage of population}_{\\text{aged 60+}}}{100}\\]\n \nIf this is below about 20 people then you should consider how you will collect the required overall sample size. Three approaches may be used:\n\nRelax the eligibility criteria: You may decide to define older people as “persons aged 50 years or older” or “persons aged 55 years or older”. This may double the size of the eligible population and make the sample easier to collect. This approach is only reasonable if life-expectancy is low.\nIncrease the number of communities that you plan to sample: You may choose to collect your sample as \\(n = 7\\) eligible subjects sampled from \\(m = 30\\) communities giving an expected overall sample size of \\(n = 210\\). This would be a very good sample. The disadvantage of this approach is that survey costs increase with the number of communities that are sampled, because a lot of survey time and vehicle costs are spent on travelling to and from the selected communities.\nTake a “top-up” sample only when you need to: The basic procedure when a selected community is small and likely to contain fewer than \\(n = 12\\) older people is to collect data on all older people in the selected community using a door-to-door census. If the within-community sample size is much smaller than the required one then a “top-up” sample is taken from the nearest neighbouring community using the map-segment-sample method (or a door-to-door census if this community is also small). The advantage of this approach is that travelling time and survey costs are better controlled.\n\nIf the proportion of older people is not very small and / or communities are large then you should have no problems achieving the overall sample size.",

    "text": "1.6 Practical sampling\n\n1.6.1 The first stage sample - list-based sampling\nThe first stage sample can be drawn from a list of all communities. The list-based sample is a simple systematic sample taken from a complete list of communities in the survey area sorted by one or more non- overlapping spatial factors (such as administrative units or electoral wards) in the survey area. Population proportional sampling (PPS) is not used since this would concentrate the sample in the larger communities.\nBelow is a worked example of how a RAM-OP first stage, list-based sample can be drawn from a survey area composed of 67 villages.\nStep 1: Calculate the sampling interval by dividing the total villages in the survey area (67 villages) with the number of villages to be drawn from the sample (16 villages).\n \n\\[\\text{Sampling Interval} ~ = ~ \\left \\lfloor ~ \\frac{N_{\\text{villages}}}{N_{\\text{sample}}} ~ \\right \\rfloor ~ = ~ \\left \\lfloor ~ \\frac{67}{16} ~ \\right \\rfloor ~ \\approx ~ \\left \\lfloor ~ 4.19 ~ \\right \\rfloor ~ \\approx ~ 4\\]\n \nThe sampling interval needs to be a whole number. Remember to always round down when calculating the sampling interval to the nearest whole number.\nStep 2: Choose a random starting point between 1 and sampling interval. In this example, this would be a random number between 1 and 4.\nA random number can be selected through simple lottery (i.e., draw from a lot of 4 numbered from 1 to 4). A standard spreadsheet software can also be used to draw the random number using the RANDBETWEEN function as follows:\n \nRANDBETWEEN(1, 4)\n \nStep 3: Using the random starting point and the sampling interval, select the sampling villages from a list of all villages organised/sorted by a non-overlapping spatial factor such as district or sub-district.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Selection of sampling villages using lists\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6.2 The first stage sample - map-based sampling\nAn alternative approach to list-based sampling is to use map-based sampling. The map-based (CSAS) sample selects communities from the centre of squares of a grid drawn over a map. The map must be sufficiently well made and of sufficiently large scale to show the position of all communities in the survey area.\nA square grid is drawn over the map. The size of the grid squares should be small enough so that the number of squares covering the survey area is the same as (or very similar to) the number of communities that you plan to sample. You may need to experiment with different grid sizes to achieve this. Figure 1.6 (a) shows an example map and grid with \\(m = 16\\) grid squares.\nThe sample is drawn by selecting the community that is located closest to the centre of each grid square:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Selection of sampling villages using maps\n\n\n\nIf two or more villages are located the same distance from the centre of a grid square then a single village is picked at random, by tossing a coin for example.\nFigure 1.6 (b) shows the sample selected by this process for the area shown in Figure 1.6 (a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Drawing a square grid over the map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Drawing the first-stage CSAS sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Map-based sampling\n\n\n\nBoth the list-based and the map-based (CSAS) sampling methods spread the sample of communities evenly across the entire survey area. Each community has an equal chance of being included in the sample. Population proportional sampling (PPS) is not used since this would concentrate the sample in the larger communities.\nThe same method can be used when sampling in urban contexts. Figure 1.7 (a) shows a sample drawn from a list of census enumeration areas sorted by administrative district. Figure 1.7 (b) shows a sample drawn using the map- based (CSAS) method. In both cases the primary sampling units (PSUs) are census enumeration areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Example of an urban sample (list-based)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Example of an urban sample (map-based)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: List-based vs map-based sampling\n\n\n\nNote: In this example twenty-one (21) blocks have been selected. It can be difficult to achieve exactly the number of blocks that you need when using this type of sample. It is best to select more rather than fewer blocks than you need Here we would take our sample as \\(n = 10\\) individuals from \\(m = 21\\) blocks (overall \\(n = 210\\)).\n\n\n1.6.3 The second stage (within-community) sample\nThe second stage (within-community) sample uses a map-segment-sample approach:\nMap: Make a rough map of the community to be sampled. It is helpful to think of communities as being made of ribbons (i.e. lines of dwellings located along roads, tracks, or rivers) and clusters of dwellings.\nHere is an example of a ribbon of dwellings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Example of a ribbon of dwellings\n\n\n\nHere is an example of a cluster of dwellings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: Example of a cluster of dwellings\n\n\n\nSegment: Divide the community into ribbon and cluster segments defined by the physical layout of the community being sampled.\nSample: Ribbons and clusters are sampled in different ways:\n\nRibbons are sampled using systematic sampling.\nClusters are sampled using a random walk method.\n\nNote: If a small community is selected that is likely to have fewer than the required number of eligible persons then all eligible persons in that community are sampled by moving door-to-door.\n\n\n1.6.4 Mapping the community - single and multiple clusters\nSome communities consist of a single cluster of dwellings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: Example of a cluster of dwellings\n\n\n\nor a set of clusters of dwellings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.11: Example of a set of clusters of dwellings\n\n\n\nFor communities (or parts of communities) structured in this way we use a sampling method called the random walk.\n\n\n1.6.5 Mapping the community - ribbon communities\nRibbon communities have dwellings arranged in a line:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.12: Dwellings arranged in a line\n\n\n\nor in several lines:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.13: Dwellings arranged in several lines\n\n\n\nFor communities (or parts of communities) structured in this way we use a sampling method called systematic sampling.\n\n\n1.6.6 Mapping the community - mixed communities\nSome communities are a mixture of clusters and ribbons:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.14: Mixture of clusters and ribbons\n\n\n\nFor mixed communities we use a mixture of the random walk method (in the clusters) and systematic sampling (along the ribbons).\nSegmentation involves dividing a community into several parts and taking part of the within-community sample from each segment. With simple communities, segmentation is not required and we take a single sample from the entire community using the appropriate sampling method.\n\n\n1.6.7 Segmentation\nFor more complicated communities we divide the community into several parts or segments, such as a community made up of several clusters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.15: Example of a set of clusters of dwellings\n\n\n\nor a community made up of several ribbons:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.16: Dwellings arranged in several lines\n\n\n\nor a mixed community:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.17: Mixture of clusters and ribbons\n\n\n\nWe take a small sample from each segment using the appropriate sampling method.\nFor example, with a community made up of three segments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.18: Community made up of three segments\n\n\n\nwe would take one third of the overall sample from each segment.\nIf the within-community sample size is twelve eligible subjects. we would sample four eligible subjects from each segment (i.e. \\(12 / 3 = 4\\)).\nDividing the sample up in this way means that we will sample from every part of the community rather than just one part of the community.\nWhen taking the sample we use the random walk method to take part of the sample from clusters and the systematic sampling method to take part of the sample from ribbons.\nSegments should be either ribbons or clusters but should never contain both a ribbon and a cluster. This is because clusters and ribbons are sampled in different ways.\nA dwelling can only belong to one segment. Segments should not overlap.\n\n\n1.6.8 Sample dwellings\nAll segments should be sampled.\nIf, for example, there are five segments in a community:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.19: Community made up of five segments\n\n\n\nand the within-community sample size is twelve eligible subjects, then you would plan to sample two eligible subjects from each segment (i.e. \\(12 / 5 = 2.4\\) rounded down to two) and, if necessary, return to the largest segment to complete the sample.\nAll segments should be sampled, even if this means that you take a larger sample than you expected to.\nRemember that different types of segment are sampled in different ways:\n\nDwellings in cluster segments are sampled using a method called the random walk. This involves sampling houses by walking in random directions within the cluster.\nDwellings in ribbon segments are sampled using a method called systematic sampling. This involves sampling houses at regular intervals along the ribbon.\n\nWe will look at each of these sampling methods in turn.\n\n\n1.6.9 Random walk sampling\nThe random walk method is used to sample dwellings in cluster segments. Sampling proceeds as follows:\n\nMove to the approximate centre of the cluster.\nSelect a random direction by spinning a bottle on the ground. The neck indicates the sampling direction. This is the direction you should walk in order to sample a dwelling. Walk in the sampling direction counting the dwellings that you pass. Sample the third dwelling. If there are no eligible persons in the selected dwelling then sample the nearest dwelling with an eligible person. Sample all eligible persons in the selected dwelling.\nApply the survey questionnaire for all eligible persons in the selected dwelling.\nSelect the next dwelling to sample by spinning a bottle and walking in the indicated direction. Count the dwellings you pass. Sample the third dwelling. If there are no eligible persons in the selected dwelling then sample the nearest dwelling with an eligible person. Sample all eligible persons in the selected dwelling. If you reach the edge of the cluster segment then return to the centre of the cluster and repeat step (2) above. Remember to keep count of the number of eligible persons sampled from the segment.\nStop sampling in the segment when you have sampled the required number of eligible persons from the segment. Since you sample all eligible persons in a selected dwelling, you may sample a few more eligible persons than expected. This is OK. Always sample all eligible persons in a selected dwelling.\n\nIf, when you have sampled all segments, you have not sampled twelve eligible persons, you should return to the largest segment to finish sampling using the appropriate sampling method.\nThe random walk method is illustrated in Figure @ref(fig:sample22).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.20: Random walk sampling in a cluster\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6.10 Systematic sampling\nThe systematic sampling method is used to sample houses in ribbon segments.\nSampling proceeds as follows:\n\nMove to one end of the ribbon segment.\nWalk to the other end of the segment counting the houses that you pass.\nCalculate the step size by dividing the number of dwellings in the segment by the required sample size for the segment. Use the whole number part of the result only. Do not round up.\nPick a random number between one and the step size. This is your starting point. Select the first dwelling to sample by walking along the segment counting the dwellings that you pass and sample the dwelling indicated by the starting point. If there are no eligible persons in the selected dwelling then sample the nearest dwelling in any direction with an eligible person. Sample all eligible persons in the selected dwelling.\nSelect the next dwelling to sample by walking along the segment. Count the dwellings that you pass. Sample the dwelling indicated by the step size. If there are no eligible persons in the selected dwelling then sample the nearest dwelling in any direction with an eligible person. Sample all eligible persons in the selected dwelling.\nStop sampling in the segment when you reach the end of the ribbon segment. This may mean that you sample extra eligible persons. This is OK. Do not stop sampling from a ribbon until you reach the end of the ribbon.\n\nIf, when you have sampled all segments, you have not sampled twelve eligible persons, you should return to the largest segment to finish sampling using the appropriate sampling method.\nThe systematic sampling method is illustrated in Figure @ref(fig:sample23).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.21: Systematic sampling in a ribbon segment\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6.11 Sampling in urban settings\nIn urban areas the first stage sample is taken by replacing sub-districts with “sections” and communities with city blocks. Examples of sections may be administrative districts/sub-districts or electoral wards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.22: Administrative divisions in an urban setting\n\n\n\nCensus enumeration areas (EAs) are usually city blocks. Central statistics offices can usually provide lists of EAs by “section” and large-scale maps of EAs selected for sampling (See Figure 1.23 and Figure 1.24). These maps make it easy to locate EAs and their boundaries. The sample of EAs can be decided using list-based or map-based (CSAS) sampling.\nIn these settings, eligible persons may be sampled by moving from door-to-door. All dwellings in the selected block are sampled and all eligible persons in the selected dwellings are sampled. This means that all eligible persons in a selected block are sampled.\nIf city blocks are large then a type of systematic sampling may be used. With this method a rough map of the streets in the block is made and the number of doorways on each street is counted and copied onto the rough street map (as shown in Figure 1.25). The total number of doorways on all streets is calculated. A step size is calculated by dividing the total number of doorways on all streets by the number of dwellings to be sampled. A systematic sample along a route around the block that includes all streets in the block is taken. Streets can be sampled in any order. If you find that you have sampled all streets but have not yet sampled the required number of eligible persons then you should return to the street with the largest number of houses to collect the remainder of the sample.\nThe number of blocks to be sampled will depend on the expected number of eligible persons in each block. You should aim for an overall sample size of about \\(n = 192\\). You should not sample fewer than \\(m = 16\\) blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.23: Enumeration area map for a city block in Freetown, Sierra Leon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.24: Enumeration area map for a city block in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.25: Systematic sampling in a city block\n\n\n\nWhen useful lists and maps are not available then satellite imagery available though free services such as Google Earth (http://earth.google.com) may be used.\nThe quality (resolution) of the images available from these services is variable but is usually good enough to allow you to segment the town into small areas of approximately equal volume (approximately the same number of dwellings) in each:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.26: Segmenting a town into smaller sampling areas\n\n\n\nWhen creating segments using maps or satellite images it is a good idea to use main roads, rivers, canals, railway lines, public parks, etc as boundaries. This simplifies the segmentation process and also simplifies fieldwork by making areas and their boundaries easier to locate and sample.\nThe first stage sample can be list-based (such as where each area is numbered in a systematic north to south and east to west order and a systematic sample taken) or map-based (CSAS).\nLarger scale “maps” of blocks to be sampled can also me made using satellite imagery (see Figure 1.27).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.27: A large scale map of a city block made from satellite imagery",

Each module is a set of indicators relating to a single dimension from the list given above and is collected using a dedicated set of questions and measurements. This means that the RAM-OP questionnaire also consists of a set of modules.\nWhenever possible, RAM-OP uses standard and validated indicators and question sets.\nIndicators are described below, showing the questionnaire components that are used to collect and record the data required, and flowcharts of the process used to derive indicators from the collected data. Standard symbols are used. For example:\nA non-standard symbol is used to show recode operations. A recode operation shows changes that are made to data so that it can be used to derive indicators without having to show many decision nodes in the flowchart. They are also used to specify what should be done with missing or out-of-range values. For example:",

This data can be queried to yield a large number of useful indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three related sets of diet-related indicators:\n\nmeal frequency\nfood groups consumed / dietary diversity\nindicators of nutrient consumption.\n\nThe indicator hierarchy is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data on the number of meals taken in the previous twenty-four hours forms a meal frequency score.\nFood intake data from each subject is combined into a dietary diversity score. The dietary diversity score is a crude measure of food security. The dietary diversity score ranges between zero (i.e. no food groups) and eleven (i.e. eleven food groups). Higher values of the dietary diversity sore are associated with better food security.\nThe meal frequency score and the dietary diversity score follow:\n\nSwindale A, Bilinsky P, Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) for measurement of household food access: Indicator guide.,Washington DC, Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance (FANTA) Project, 2006\nKennedy G, Ballard T, Dop MC, Guidelines for Measuring Household and Individual Dietary Diversity, Rome, Food and Agricultural Organization, 2010\n\nThe data on the types of food consumed in the previous twenty-four hours are analysed in order to determine the diet’s content of specific micronutrients that are important for older people.

The dietary diversity score ranges between zero (no food groups) and eleven (eleven food groups). Higher values of the dietary diversity score are associated with better food security.\n\n\n2.1.5 Indicators of nutrient consumption\nOverview\nQuestions and combinations of questions relating to the consumption of individual food items and food types can be used to determine whether the reported diet is likely to be provide sufficient nutrients of various types:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach indicator is formed using logical “or” operations (i.e. the indicator is true if any of the constituent foods are consumed). For example, the indicator for the consumption of iron rich foods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequires the consumption of one or more of green leafy vegetables, organ meats, meat, or fish and shellfish. Consumption of any of these foods is sufficient to indicate that the survey subject consumes iron rich food.\n\n2.1.5.1 Protein rich foods\nIndicators of consumption of protein rich foods from animal sources, plant source, and any / all sources are calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5.2 Vitamin A rich foods\nIndicators of consumption of vitamin A rich foods from animal sources, plant source, and any / all sources are calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5.3 Iron rich foods\nAn indicator of consumption of iron rich foods from any / all sources is calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5.4 Calcium rich foods\nAn indicator of consumption of calcium rich foods from any / all sources is calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5.5 Zinc rich foods\nAn indicator of consumption of zinc rich foods from any / all sources is calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5.6 Vitamin B rich foods\nIndicators of consumption of vitamin B rich foods from any / all sources are calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the vitamin B complex indicator requires that at least one food from each of the B1, B2, B3, B6, and B12 rich food combinations is consumed.\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Severe food insecurity\nAn indicator of severe food insecurity (hunger) is derived from this questionnaire component:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand is calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis indicator is the Household Hunger Scale (HHS) and is a simple, well-validated, and widely used indicator of severe food insecurity:\n\nBallard T, Coates J, Swindale A, Deitchler M, Household Hunger Scale: Indicator Definition and Measurement Guide, Washington DC, FANTA-2 Bridge, FHI 360, 2011\nRuel MT, Ballard TJ, Deitchler M, Measuring and Tracking the Access Dimension of Food Security: Available Indicators and Recommendations for Future Investments, Global Nutrition Report 2014: Technical Note 6, Washington DC, International Food Policy Research Institute, 2014\n\n\n\n2.1.7 Disability\nIndicators of disability across six different domains are derived from this questionnaire component:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual disability indicators are reported for each domain (i.e. vision, hearing, mobility, remembering, self-care, and communication) of disability in the Washington Group’s short set of question designed to identify people with a disability in a census or survey format:\n\nhttp://www.washingtongroup-disability.com\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/washington_group/wg_documents.htm\n\nOverall disability prevalence indicators are also reported.\nIndicators of disability in each domain are calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall disability prevalence indicators are calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP0 = 1\nif no domain has D1 = 1, else = 0 (no disability in any domain)\n\n\nP1 = 1\nif at least one domain has D1 = 1, else = 0\n\n\nP2 = 1\nif at least one domain has D2 = 1, else = 0\n\n\nP3 = 1\nif at least one domain has D3 = 1, else = 0\n\n\nPM = 1\nif at more than one domain has D1 = 1, else = 0 (M stands for “Multiple”)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.8 Activities of daily living\nIndicators of how well the subject copes with activities of daily living are derived from this questionnaire component:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual independence indicators are reported for each dimension (i.e. bathing, dressing, toilet, mobility, continence, and eating) of daily living activities.\nA composite indicator of the degree of independence (i.e. how well the subject can cope with activities of daily living) is also reported. This indicator is the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (or the Katz Index of ADL for short) and is a simple, well-validated, and widely used indicator of how well the subject can cope with activities of daily living:\n\nKatz S, Ford AB, Moskowitz RW, Jackson BA, Jaffe MW, Studies of illness in the aged. The Index of ADL: A standardized measure of biological and psychosocial function, JAMA, 185(12), 1963, pp. 914-9\nKatz S, Down TD, Cash HR, Grotz, RC, Progress in the development of the index of ADL, The Gerontologist, 10(1), 1970, pp. 20-30\nKatz S, Assessing self-maintenance: Activities of daily living, mobility and instrumental activities of daily living, JAGS, 31(12), 1983, pp. 721-726\n\nThe Katz Index of ADL ranges between zero (complete dependence) and six (independence).\n\nThe seventh question of this module, which is not part of the Katz Index of ADL, is reported separately and indicates whether the subject has someone to help them with activities of daily living:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivities of Daily Living\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na7\nIs someone taking care of you or helping you with everyday activities such as shopping, cooking, bathing and dressing?\n1 = Yes; 2 = No\n[__]\n\n\n\nIt is not possible to know if the help available completely meets a subject’s needs, but we can identify the proportion of subjects needing help with one or more activities of daily living who also report not having someone to help them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an indicator of unmet need.\n\nIndicators of how well the subject can cope with activities of daily living and probable unmet need are calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.9 Mental health and well-being\nIndicators of mental health and well being are derived from this questionnaire component:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA score is calculated. This is the Kessler K6 Psychological Distress Scale. The score ranges from zero (indicating no psychological distress) to twenty-four (indicating severe psychological distress). A score of thirteen or more indicates serious psychological distress. The Kessler K6 Psychological Distress Scale is a widely recommended, widely used, accurate, reliable, and simple measure of psychological distress:\n\nKessler RC, Andrews G, Colpe LJ, Hiripi E, Mroczek, DK, Normand SLT, et al, “Short screening scales to monitor population prevalences and trends in non-specific psychological distress”, Psychological Medicine, 32(6), 2002, pp. 959–976\nKessler RC, Barker PR, Colpe LJ, Epstein JF, Gfroerer JC, Hiripi E, “Screening for Serious Mental Illness in the General Population”, Archives of General Psychiatry, 60(2), 2003, pp. 184-189\n\nIndicators of mental health and well-being are calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.10 Dementia\nAn indicator of probable dementia is derived from this questionnaire component:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe indicator of probable dementia is calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis indicator is derived from the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia (CSID) developed by the 10/66 Dementia Research Group. This is a simple, validated, and widely used indicator of probable dementia:\n\nPrince M, et al, “A brief dementia screener suitable for use by non-specialists in resource poor settings - The cross-cultural derivation and validation of the brief Community Screening Instrument for Dementia”, International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 26(9), 2011, pp. 899–907\n\n\n\n\n2.1.11 Health and health-seeking behaviour\nIndicators of health and health-seeking behaviour for chronic and acute conditions are derived from this questionnaire component:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicators of health and health-seeking behaviour for chronic conditions are calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicators of health and health-seeking behaviour for acute conditions are calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.12 Sources of income\nIndicators related to sources of income are derived from this questionnaire component:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand are calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe grouped income sources (i.e. m2a, m2b, etc.) and individual income sources may vary between settings. The questionnaire component shown above has proved suitable for use in Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Tanzania.\n\n\n\n2.1.13 Water, sanitation, and hygiene\nIndicators relating to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are derived from this questionnaire component:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicators are calculated following:\n\nWHO / UNICEF, Core Questions on Drinking-water and Sanitation for Household Surveys, Geneva, WHO / UNICEF, 2006\n\nIndicators relating to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.14 Anthropometry and screening coverage\nIndicators relating to anthropometry and screening coverage are derived from this questionnaire component:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd are calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw MUAC data (i.e. not MUAC class) is collected, entered, and analysed. This requires that an adult MUAC tape (i.e. capable of measuring MUAC to 450 mm) is used.\nThe presence of bilateral oedema is assessed by pressing with your thumbs both feet of the older person for three seconds and checking whether this creates a lasting depression or “pit” on both feet. Bilateral pitting oedema in older people may not be “nutritional” oedema (as is almost always the case with children). Older people with bilateral pitting oedema should be advised to consult a doctor.\nThe prevalence of GAM, MAM, and SAM are estimated using a PROBIT estimator. This type of estimator provides better precision than a classic estimator at small sample sizes:\n\nWorld Health Organisation, Physical Status: The use and interpretation of anthropometry. Report of a WHO expert committee, WHO Technical Report Series 854, WHO, Geneva, 1995\nDale NM, Myatt M, Prudhon C, Briend, A, “Assessment of the PROBIT approach for estimating the prevalence of global, moderate and severe acute malnutrition from population surveys”, Public Health Nutrition, 1–6. doi:10.1017/S1368980012003345, 2012\nBlanton CJ, Bilukha, OO, “The PROBIT approach in estimating the prevalence of wasting: revisiting bias and precision”, Emerging Themes in Epidemiology, 10(1), 2013, p. 8\n\nThe PROBIT estimator is described in Box 1.\nMUAC-based case definitions for acute malnutrition are used:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGAM | MUAC &lt; 210 mm\n\n\nMAM | 185 mm ≤ MUAC &lt; 210mm\n\n\nSAM | MUAC &lt; 185mm\n\n\n\nThese are standard case definitions for acute malnutrition in adults and recommended by HelpAge International for use in older people in humanitarian contexts.\nNote : MUAC in adults should be measured on the non-dominant arm. This is usually the left arm. The importance of high levels of accuracy and precision at the individual level is of lesser importance in survey work compared to case-finding or diagnosis in clinical contexts, for example. This means that a simple rule such as “Always measure MUAC on the left arm” may be used.\n\n\n\n\nAn estimate of GAM prevalence can be made using a classic estimator:\n\\[\\text{prevalence} = \\frac{\\text{number of respondents with MUAC &lt; 210 mm}}{\\text{total number of respondents}}\\]\nThe estimate of GAM prevalence made from the RAM-OP survey data is made using a PROBIT estimator. The PROBIT function is also known as the inverse cumulative distribution function. This function converts parameters of the distribution of an indicator (e.g. the mean and standard deviation of a normally distributed variable) into cumulative percentiles. This means that it is possible to use the normal PROBIT function with estimates of the mean and standard deviation of indicator values in a survey sample to predict (or estimate) the proportion of the population falling below a given threshold. For example, for data with a mean MUAC of 256 mm and a standard deviation of 28 mm the output of the normal PROBIT function for a threshold of 210 mm is 0.0502 meaning that 5.02% of the population are predicted (or estimated) to fall below the 210 mm threshold.\n \nBoth the classic and the PROBIT methods can be thought of as estimating area:\n \n\n \nThe principal advantage of the PROBIT approach is that the required sample size is usually smaller than that required to estimate prevalence with a given precision using the classic method.\n \nThe PROBIT method assumes that MUAC is a normally distributed variable. If this is not the case then the distribution of MUAC is transformed towards normality.\n \nThe prevalence of SAM is estimated in a similar way to GAM. The prevalence of MAM is estimated as the difference between the GAM and SAM prevalence estimates:\n\\[\\widehat{MAM prevalence} = \\widehat{GAM prevalence} - \\widehat{SAM prevalence}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.15 Visual impairment\nAn indicator of visual impairment is derived from this questionnaire component:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd is calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “illiterate E” or “tumbling E” (the preferred term) is a validated and widely used method for measuring visual acuity:\n\nTaylor HR, “Applying new design principles to the construction of an illiterate E chart”, American Journal of Optometry & Physiological Optics, 55:348, 1978\nKaiser PK, “Prospective Evaluation of Visual Acuity Assessment: A Comparison of Snellen Versus ETDRS Charts in Clinical Practice (An AOS Thesis)”, Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society, 107: 311–324, 2009\n\n\nThe size of the “E” used:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nas well as the distance used for the test (two metres) and the indicator calculation apply the WHO case definition of visual impairment (i.e. visual acuity &lt; 6 / 18).\nThe tumbling E card should be laminated (i.e. plastic coated and have a two metre cord attached which helps to ensure that the visual acuity test is performed at the correct distance (See Figure @ref(fig:indicators29)).\nAfter demonstrating to the respondent what the test is about (i.e. the subject should indicate which direction the branches of the ‘E’ are pointing), the test is administered at a distance of two meters, turning the card in four different directions, and asking the person to indicate which direction the branches of the “E” is pointing. If the subject wears glasses, they are allowed to use them during the test if they want to.\nNote : If the person is unable to correctly answer at least three times out of four, they have a visual impairment. A simple visual acuity test such as the ‘tumbling E’ test also does not indicate anything about an underlying disease such as glaucoma or the need for reading spectacles (presbyopia). These conditions are common in people aged 60 years or older. Subjects failing the visual acuity test should be counselled to visit an ophthalmologist for a detailed eye examination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquipment used to measure visual acuity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.16 Miscellaneous indicators\nData for a small group of miscellaneous indicators are also collected and reported. These are derived from these questions:\nHunger – Ration - Relief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf6\nAre you or anyone in your household receiving a food ration on a regular basis?\n1 = Yes; 2 = No\n[__]\n\n\nf7\nHave you or another member of your household received non-food relief items such as soap, bucket, water container, bedding, mosquito net, clothes, or plastic sheet in the previous four weeks?\n1 = Yes; 2 = No\n[__]\n\n\n\n \nActivities of Daily Living\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na8\nDo you have problems chewing food?\n1 = Yes; 2 = No\n[__]\n\n\n\n\nand are calculated as:",

    "text": "2.2 A note on data management and data analysis\nThis section has described how RAM-OP data is used to create a broad set of indicators. If you do not want to use the standard RAM-OP software to do this then you can use this information to create data entry systems and data management scripts for your favoured database or statistical analysis software. See the sections on RAM-OP datasets and RAM-OP questionnaire for more compact information on variable names and codes that you may find helpful.\nIt is important to note that data analysis procedures need to account for the sample design. All major statistical analysis software can do this (details vary). There are two things to note:\n\nThe RAM-OP sample is a two-stage sample. Subjects are sampled from a small number of primary sampling units (PSUs).\nThe RAM-OP sample is not prior weighted. This means that you will need to provide per-PSU sampling weights. These are usually the populations of the PSU.\n\nYou will need to specify this sample design to your statistical analysis software. If you fail to do this then your analysis may produce estimates that place undue weight to observations from smaller communities with confidence intervals with lower than nominal coverage (i.e. they will be too narrow).\nThe standard RAM-OP software uses blocked weighted bootstrap estimation approach:\n\nBlocked : The block corresponds to the PSU or cluster.\nWeighted : The RAM-OP sampling procedure does not use population proportional sampling to weight the sample prior to data collection as is done with SMART type surveys. This means that a posterior weighting procedure is required. The standard RAM-OP software uses a “roulette wheel” algorithm to weight (i.e. by population) the selection probability of PSUs in bootstrap replicates.\n\nA total of m' PSUs are sampled with-replacement from the survey dataset where m' is the number of PSUs in the survey sample. Individual records within each PSU are then sampled with-replacement. A total of n’ records are sampled with-replacement from each of the selected PSUs where n' is the number of individual records in a selected PSU. The resulting collection of records replicates the original survey in terms of both sample design and sample size. A large number of replicate surveys are taken (the standard RAM-OP software uses \\(r = 399\\) replicate surveys but this can be changed). The required statistic (e.g. the mean of an indicator value) is applied to each replicate survey. The reported estimate consists of the 50th (point estimate), 2.5th (lower 95% confidence limit), and the 97.5th (upper 95% confidence limit) percentiles of the distribution of the statistic observed across all replicate surveys. The blocked weighted bootstrap procedure is outlined in Figure @ref(fig:indicators31).\nThe principal advantages of using a bootstrap estimator are:\n\nBootstrap estimators work well with small sample sizes.\nThe method is non-parametric and uses empirical rather than theoretical distributions. There are no assumptions of things like normality to worry about.\nThe method allows estimation of the sampling distribution of almost any statistic using only simple computational methods.\n\nThe standard RAM-OP data analysis software is described in the section Standard RAM-OP software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blocked weighted bootstrap used by the standard RAM-OP software",

    "text": "Modules of the RAM-OP questionnaire are presented in the RAM-OP indicators section of this manual. The entire RAM-OP questionnaire is presented in the following pages. This questionnaire is composed of many tested and validated components. The order of the questions and the format of the questionnaire have been tested in several settings (Chad, Dadaab Camps, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Tanzania) over a period of three years. It is strongly recommended that you do not change the questionnaire, other than translating it into a language other than English and necessary localisation (i.e. adapting the questions to meet the language, cultural, and other requirements of a specific target population in order to ensure that the words, names, terms, and concepts used are culturally appropriate and understandable to them), unless you are very sure of what you are doing. Modifying the questionnaire may have one or more of the following consequences:\n\nModifying the order of the questions or adding questions : The links with the data entry, data checking, and data analysis software will be broken. You will have to modify the software to accommodate your changes.\nModifying the variable names : The links with the data entry, data checking, and data analysis software will be broken. You will have to modify the software to accommodate your changes.\nModifying the content or the phrasing of questions : All questions have been tested and are formulated for accuracy and reliability (precision). Modifying them may lead to loss of accuracy (bias) and precision\n\nWhen translating the questionnaire you should check if validated question sets for each indicator module are already available in your local language. This is likely to be the case for the food intake, severe food insecurity, activities of daily living, mental health and well-being, dementia, water / sanitation / hygiene, and visual impairment indicator modules. There may also be local language training modules and guidelines available for these modules.\nLocalisation is recommended for:\n\nFood groups : Remove inappropriate foodstuffs and give examples of local foodstuffs.\nIncome sources : Review income types and income categories.\n\nThe question numbers used on the questionnaire are the names of variables used in the RAM-OP data entry, data checking, and data analysis software. Leaving these as they are will be helpful if you intend to use the RAM-OP data-entry and data-analysis software.\nThe questionnaire can be downloaded (in ODT and PDF format) from http://www.brixtonhealth.com/qesRAMOP.zip",

Figure @ref(fig:dataset02) shows an example of a PSU dataset in comma-separate-value (CSV) format.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example comma-separated-value (CSV) format file (the example is for a RAM-OP PSU dataset)\n\n\n\n\nNote that the first line of a CSV format file gives the names of the variables (e.g. these are psu and pop for the PSU dataset) separated by commas. Subsequent lines contain data with items separated by commas and with one record per line. CSV format files can be created using a plain text editor (e.g. Notepad) or with a spreadsheet application such as Microsoft Excel™. If you use a spreadsheet application then you will have to be careful:\n\nVariable names and data items must be separated by commas (not tab characters or semi-colon characters).\nNumbers with decimal places must use the full-stop character as the decimal separator. In some settings a spreadsheet application may want to use the comma character as the decimal separator.\nAvoid using accented characters in the names of and in the data entered into text variables. These characters can sometimes confuse the RAM-OP data analysis software. A CSV file should contain only plain text, number, and commas without formatting. Do not use a word processor application such as Microsoft Word™ to create or edit a CSV file.\n\nIf you have problems using a CSV file then you should check and edit the file using a plain text-editor such as Notepad or a dedicated CSV editor such as Ron’s Editor (http://www.ronsplace.eu/Products/RonsEditor)\nRemember to backup your data before editing it.",

In humanitarian contexts, this might be the only clearance that you will need at the national level.\nEthical approval : This is obtained from the country’s national ethical committee (or equivalent). Some NGOs and UNOs also have ethical committees and you may also need to submit your survey plans to them for ethical approval. It may be necessary to work with both national and local ethical committees. The process of gaining ethical approval can take several months. It is important to note that RAM-OP surveys are needs assessments rather than experiments upon human subjects. This means that ethical clearance may not be required for RAM-OP surveys, or that it can be given by the chair of the appropriate ethical review committee without the need for a full meeting of the ethical review committee. It is a good idea to check this with the chair of the appropriate committees to see if permissions can be expedited. Getting ethical clearance is often very useful when applying for other permission as it shows that some technical quality assurance has been done.\nAuthorisation from the appropriate government departments at various levels (i.e. national, regional, and at the level where you are going to implement the survey). Authorisation of the authority managing the survey site should be sought. For example, a survey in a refugee camp will need the authorisation of UNHCR, the national administrative authority in charge of refugees and displaced persons, and the agency in charge of the camp management. In some settings you may also need to obtain authorisation from other government departments such as the Ministry of Health, the Department of Rural Affairs, or the Department of Social Affairs.\nAuthorisation from the administrative authorities at local level : Make sure that all levels of the local administration are informed about what you intend to do (i.e. what, where, and when). It is essential to meet with the local administrative and health authorities prior to the survey. This is done to avoid problems with permissions and to involve them in the implementation of the survey. Describe the survey and explain what might be expected from their staff. You might, for example, need some help in identifying the exact location and boundaries of villages and hamlets in rural areas, or blocks and sections of towns in urban areas. You might need translators or guides to travel with the enumerators, and you might need facilitators to introduce you to village executives. Make sure that you share the results of the survey with them once it is available.\nSecurity clearance : Be aware of the potential security problems in the survey area. Inform all agencies with security responsibilities in the area about the dates and locations of the survey. The police or the army may have to be specifically informed. You may also need to negotiate access with non-state actors. Field staff should be provided with copies of official documents (in the local language) proving that they are authorised to carry out survey work in the specific area between specific dates. They will have to carry this document with them at all times during the fieldwork and present it on request to local authorities and study subjects. It can also be useful to give a copy of this and other official documents to village leaders on arrival at the survey location.",

This information should be disseminated before the survey starts and reiterated a day or two before teams travel to survey locations either by telephone or by personal visits.\nProvide you with a list of useful contacts (with telephone numbers) for each of the areas covered by the survey.

This allows enumerators to ask questions using the same language and terminology in every interview.\nThorough training of the enumerators in applying the questionnaire will also improve the precision and accuracy of your survey results.\nA translated questionnaire may also be a requirement for getting the ethical clearance for the survey.\nWe advise you to use an iterative translation process and use:\n\nStandard language if available : Most indicators used in RAM-OP have question sets available in different languages. You can check for these online. You may need to alter some language to account for local dialects and idioms but using standard language, when it is available, can save you a lot of time and effort\nKnowledgeable lead translators : You need to use people who know the target language and culture but are also fluent in the starting language of the questionnaire.\nForward translation and back translation : The questionnaire is translated from English, for example, into the local language by one person or team (this is forward translation) and is then translated back into the original language by another person or team (this is back translation). The back translated questionnaire is then checked against the original questionnaire. Differences are then analysed and a new translation produced. You may need to go through this process several times until a satisfactory version of the translated questionnaire is reached.\nYour survey staff to provide language and to pilot (i.e. test) questionnaire components as they are translated. Piloting can be done with community members and by role-playing between survey staff. Test interviews and group discussions usually help to improve the language used in the questionnaire.\nYour intended survey population to help you make sure that the language you are using is simple and to the point. Test interviews and group discussions usually help to improve the language used in the questionnaire.\n\nHaving enumerators translate the English language questionnaire (for example) each time they apply the questionnaire is not a good option and should be avoided.",

However, the number of teams should be linked to your capacity for supervision. Also, having a large number of teams usually means that you will need a large number of vehicles and drivers. This can be hard to achieve and hard to manage.\nWe recommend that you recruit three teams of two enumerators with one supervisor per team. The duties of supervisors and enumerators are:\nSupervisors have to take all necessary actions to ensure the accuracy of the collected data, particularly:\n\nChecking equipment before departure and when leaving the survey site.\nTravelling with a team every day, to observe and correct the enumerators’ work.\nIntroducing teams to local leaders.\nEnsuring households and subjects are selected properly, that the interviews are conducted with respect and thoroughness, and that measurements are taken and recorded accurately.\n\nEnumerators are in charge of implementing the field procedures:\n\nIdentifying the households to survey.\nApply the questionnaires to older people.\nMeasure MUAC, oedema, and visual acuity and complete questionnaires.\n\nIf each team can complete a single PSU per day (this is the minimum you can expect from a team) then the survey may be completed in six days (i.e. three PSUs per day for five days plus one PSU on the last day). This will depend on context and on the teams’ expertise. It is often possible for a team to reach more than one location per day, such as in cities or camps where sectors and blocks are close to each other and travelling time is not high. You will often find that survey data can be collected in just four or five days.\nIt is important not to rush data collection. It is also important to supervise the teams from day one in order to ensure they follow the proper sampling procedures and applying the questionnaires correctly.\nIt is advisable to enlist more enumerators to be trained than the minimum number needed. This will ensure that you have sufficient enumerators should you find, during training, that some recruits cannot perform their duties well enough. It will also provide additional trained staff should you need to cover for absences, due to illness for example. Make sure that you enlist both male and female trainees.\nYou will also need to recruit data entry staff. The workload for the data entry staff is usually between about thirty-six and seventy-two questionnaires per day.",

Each training day should contain some work on the questionnaire. Particular attention is paid to the content and function of each question set, the numbering system for the PSU, household, and subject, the meaning / intention of each question set, skip / jump patterns, coding, ranges, and checking for completeness and consistency. Extensive use should be made of role-playing (in pairs and in groups) and testing with eligible subjects. Care needs to be taken to ensure that all field staff have extensive practice in working with the questionnaire.\nPractising measurements : This is very important. Most training days should contain some work on measurement. Care needs to be taken to ensure that all field staff have extensive practice in taking all measurements.\nStandardisation of measurement : A formal standardisation exercise for MUAC measurement is not required. The format of such an exercise does, however, provide a useful framework for training enumerators to measure MUAC with acceptable accuracy and precision by:\n\nComparisons of measurements made by different enumerators on the same person to explore accuracy (bias).\nComparisons of measurements made by different enumerators on the same person with the measurements made by the training supervisor to explore accuracy (bias).\nRepeated measurements on the same persons by the same enumerator to explore repeatability (precision).\n\nTen older people : The survey facilitator should be able to mobilise ten older people (women and men) to participate in questionnaire and measurement exercises. Make sure to explain to these volunteers what is going to happen to them. The exercises will last a half day (maybe longer) and may be quite tiring for older persons. Make sure they are comfortably accommodated, organise their transport to and from the training venue (which should be easily accessible and so avoiding stairs), indoors or under shelter, with chairs or benches. Provide safe drinking water and possibly tea, coffee and snacks. It is also advisable to provide them with a small ex gratia payment.\nThe field test : This will put the trainees in to field conditions but without the stress of having to take a full sample. It is a “dummy run” of all survey activities. Divide the trainees into teams assigning a supervisor to each team. The test area should not be one of the areas to be sampled for the survey and can be close to the training venue.\n\nAt the end of the training week, you should be able to select the best enumerators and divide them in to teams, balancing genders and personalities, as well as strengths and weaknesses.",

We accept the respondents’ statement of their own age, and we do not challenge them if they appear younger or older than the age they declare. We usually do not ask for a proof of age. However, it might be useful to have compiled a list of events related to the past hundred years of the country’s history, as some older people do not remember their age, but remember living at the time of some remarkable events (independence, elections, wars, etc). Women often remember the age at which they had their children\nAll eligible older people present in and belonging to the sampled household are interviewed and measured, even if the required quota of respondents has been reached. Older people visiting the household should only be included if they are residing there for more than two weeks. Person such as maids, houseboys, watchmen, and carers should be treated as part of the household (i.e. should be interviewed) if the sampled dwelling / compound is their principal place of residence. Older people should be interviewed in their houses. It is not good practice to have the older people in the community gathered in one place.\nWhen entering older people’s houses, the enumerators should always be polite, respectful, and attentive not to intrude on people’s privacy.\nOlder people should not be intimidated into answering the questionnaire or being measured. They always have a right to refuse to answer some or all of the questions and to refuse measurements. Refusals should be noted on the questionnaire.\nSome of the questions are of an intimate nature. Be careful not to administer the questionnaire in an open space where everybody present can hear the answers. This may embarrass the respondent or cause the respondent to answer wrongly. This is important as a “wrong answer” will tend to hide need and will bias the survey results.\nSome older women may object to having their MUAC taken by a man (or vice versa). This is why it is advisable that the team has both male and female members. This not always possible, but older people are often more free from prejudices than the younger members of their community. It is rare for an older woman to refuse to expose her arms or feet before a male enumerator, and also rare that an older man objects to being measured by a female enumerator.",

This is just a normal folder or directory that can be created using your usual file manager (e.g. Windows ExplorerTM in WindowsTM or the FinderTM in Macintosh OS-XTM). The project directory or project folder should contain:\n\nYour PSU file (here we assume this file is called testPSU.csv but it could have any name). This file must be a comma-separated-value (CSV) file.\nYour survey data file (here we assume this file is called testSVY.rec but it could have any name). This file can be an EpiData (REC) file or a comma-separated-value (CSV) file.\nThe language file (always called ramOP.language.csv). This file provides text that is used in reports and graphics. The purpose of this file is to make the data analysis software produce reports in any language. This file must be a comma-separated-value (CSV) file.\nA copy of the file ramOP.rflow.\n\nWhen you have created the project directory or project folder with the required files you can start RAnalyticFlow.\nNote: The testSVY.rec and testPSU.csv files are example data files and are distributed with the RAnalyticFlow workflow. You can use these files to practice analysing data using RAnalyticFlow, and as examples of RAM-OP survey data and PSU files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you start work you will need to create a project for your survey:\n\nClick the New Project… button\nGive your project a useful (i.e. descriptive and memorable) name. This might be a name that describes the survey. For example, if the survey was done in the Kereinik locality of West Darfur in December 2015 you might use the name WD.Kereinik.Dec2015.RAMOP\nGive the location of your project directory or project folder. This is the directory or folder which contains your survey data file, your PSU file, the RAM-OP language file, and a copy of RAMOP.rflow (see previous page). The location of the project directory or project folder (labelled “Path” by the software) that RAnalyticFlow selects automatically will almost always be wrong. You need to specify this manually.\nClick the OK button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click the item named ramOP.rflow shown in the file manager pane of the RAnalyticFlow window. This will open the data-analysis workflow which will be shown in the workflow viewer / editor window of the RAnalyticFlow window.\nOnce you have opened the workflow you need to initialise it (i.e. load libraries, useful analysis function, and initialise the workspace for a new analysis):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce this is done, you should:\n\nRetrieve your survey data. This can be in EpiData (REC) format or CSV format. Select and run the appropriate Survey Data node and select the survey data file.\nRetrieve the PSU date data. Select and run the PSU Data node and select your PSU file.\nProduce the survey report and graphics. Select and run the Report node. This will take some time to complete because the analysis uses computer intensive techniques to make best use of the available data. The Report node/icon will have black lines around it has completed running the report.\n\nWhen the analysis is complete your project directory or project folder should contain eight new files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe files ending in .png are graphics files. The names of these files are intended to be informative. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file ending in .report.csv is the survey report file (see below).\nThere may also be a file ending in .afp. This is a project information file used by RAnalyticFlow and can be ignored.\nThe file ending in .report.csv is the survey report file. This file can be opened, formatted and edited in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the illustration above, proportions have been formatted as percentages with one decimal place, means have been formatted as numbers with two decimal places, and column titles have been formatted as bold text.\nYou can edit the labels as you see fit. If you plan to do several RAM-OP surveys then you may want to edit the language file (always called ramOP.language.csv). This file provides text that is used in reports and graphics. The purpose of this file is to make the data analysis software produce reports in any language. This file must be a comma-separated-value (CSV) file.",

    "text": "We live in an ageing world, where people aged 60 or over will be 2 billion or about 22% of the world’s population by 2050.\nCurrently, two in three people aged 60 years or older live in developing countries. By 2050, nearly four in five older people will be living in the developing world.\nThe changing demographics of ageing combined with the increasing number of disasters will exert a disproportionate impact on the world’s oldest and poorest.\nIn this context, identifying the needs of older people as accurately as possible is a necessity. More and more donors and UN agencies are now willing to include older people in their programmes. Age markers, to complement gender markers, will be disseminated very soon\nRAM-OP is offering a fast, robust, reliable, tested and user-friendly way of assessing the needs of older people. It can be used in humanitarian situations as well as in development contexts. The modular structure of RAM-OP allows for adaptations, making it exhaustive or limited to essential indicators according to the immediate needs.\nAs more organisations start to use it, RAM-OP will evolve and improve. New versions of RAM-OP can be created (for example, RAM-OP for refugee or displaced people camps). We wish that a greater number of actors will start using RAM-OP and make it their own.",
