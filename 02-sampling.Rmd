# The RAM-OP sample {#sampling}

RAM-OP uses a two-stage sample:

**First stage sample:** A sample of communities (e.g. villages or city-blocks) in the survey area is
taken. A sampled community is also called a primary sampling unit (PSU).

**Second stage sample:** Domestic dwellings are sampled from within the communities selected in the
first stage sample. All eligible individuals in the sampled dwelling are included in the sample.

The first stage sample is a systematic spatial sample. Two methods can be used and both methods take the sample from all parts of the survey area:

**List-based method:** Communities to be sampled are selected systematically from a complete list of communities in the survey area. This list of communities is sorted by one or more non-overlapping spatial factors such as district and subdistricts within districts:
