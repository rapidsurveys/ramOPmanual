	abstract = {Background Public Law 102-321 established a block grant for adults with "serious mental illness" ({SMI}) and required the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ({SAMHSA}) to develop a method to estimate the prevalence of {SMI}.Methods Three {SMI} screening scales were developed for possible use in the {SAMHSA} National Household Survey on Drug Abuse: the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short-Form ({CIDI}-{SF}) scale, the K10/K6 nonspecific distress scales, and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule ({WHO}-{DAS}). An enriched convenience sample of 155 respondents was administered all screening scales followed by the 12-month Structured Clinical Interview for {DSM}-{IV} and the Global Assessment of Functioning ({GAF}). We defined {SMI} as any 12-month {DSM}-{IV} disorder, other than a substance use disorder, with a {GAF} score of less than 60.Results All screening scales were significantly related to {SMI}. However, neither the {CIDI}-{SF} nor the {WHO}-{DAS} improved prediction significantly over the K10 or K6 scales. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of {SMI} was 0.854 for K10 and 0.865 for K6. The most efficient screening scale, K6, had a sensitivity ({SE}) of 0.36 (0.08) and a specificity of 0.96 (0.02) in predicting {SMI}.Conclusions The brevity and accuracy of the K6 and K10 scales make them attractive screens for {SMI}. Routine inclusion of either scale in clinical studies would create an important, and heretofore missing, crosswalk between community and clinical epidemiology.},

	abstract = {The {PROBIT} methodology was presented in the 1995 World Health Organization Technical Report on Anthropometry as an alternative to the standard prevalence based method of measuring malnutrition in children. Theoretically the {PROBIT} method will always give a smaller standard error than the standard prevalence method in measuring malnutrition. A recent article by Dale et al. assessed the {PROBIT} method for measuring global acute malnutrition measure and found that the method was biased and the precision was superior only for sample sizes less than 150 when compared to the standard method. In a manner similar to Dale, our study further investigated the bias and precision of the {PROBIT} method for different sample sizes using simulated populations. The {PROBIT} method showed bias for each of the ten simulated populations, but the direction and magnitude of the average bias was changed depending on the simulated population. For a given simulated population, the average bias was relatively constant for all sample sizes drawn. The 95\% half-width confidence interval was lower for the {PROBIT} method than the standard prevalence method regardless of the sample size or simulated population. The absolute difference in the confidence limits showed the most gains for the {PROBIT} method for the smaller samples sizes, but the ratio of confidence intervals was relatively constant across all sample sizes. The {PROBIT} method will provide gains in precision regardless of the sample size, but the method may be biased. The direction and magnitude of the bias depends on the population it is drawn from.},
